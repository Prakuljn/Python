Instead of writing specific code to solve a problem, you feed the system data and algorithms that allow it to learn patterns, make predictions, and improve its performance over time.  Think of it as teaching a computer to \"figure things out\" on its own.\n",

            "    *   **Numerical Data:**  Numbers, like sensor readings, stock prices, or customer ages.\n",
            "    *   **Categorical Data:**  Labels, like colors (red, blue, green), types of fruit (apple, banana, orange), or customer demographics (male, female).\n",
            "    *   **Text Data:**  Documents, emails, social media posts.\n",
            "    *   **Image Data:**  Photographs, medical scans, satellite images.\n",
            "    *   **Audio Data:**  Voice recordings, music, environmental sounds.\n",
            "    *   **Video Data:**  Movies, surveillance footage, animations.\n",
            "*   **Features:**  Individual measurable properties or characteristics of the data. For example, in a dataset of houses, features might include square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and age.\n",
            "*   **Labels/Targets:**  The \"answer key\" or the value the machine learning model is trying to predict. In supervised learning, labels are provided alongside the data during training.  For example, if you're building a model to classify emails as spam or not spam, the labels would be \"spam\" or \"not spam.\"\n",
            "\n",

            "    *   **Regression:**  Predicting a continuous numerical value. Examples: predicting house prices, estimating temperature, forecasting sales. Algorithms include linear regression, polynomial regression, support vector regression, and decision tree regression.\n",
            "    *   **Classification:**  Categorizing data into distinct classes. Examples: spam detection, image recognition (identifying objects in images), medical diagnosis. Algorithms include logistic regression, support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees, random forests, and naive Bayes.\n",
            "*   **Unsupervised Learning:**  The algorithm learns from unlabeled data.  It aims to discover patterns and structures within the data. Common unsupervised learning algorithms include:\n",
            "    *   **Clustering:**  Grouping similar data points together. Examples: customer segmentation, anomaly detection, image compression. Algorithms include k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN.\n",
            "    *   **Dimensionality Reduction:**  Reducing the number of features while preserving important information. Examples: feature selection, data visualization. Algorithms include principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE).\n",
            "    *   **Association Rule Learning:** Discovering relationships between variables in a dataset. Example: market basket analysis\n",
            "*   **Reinforcement Learning:**  The algorithm learns through trial and error, interacting with an environment and receiving feedback (rewards or penalties) for its actions.  It aims to develop a strategy (policy) that maximizes its cumulative reward. Examples: game playing (like AlphaGo), robotics control, resource management. Algorithms include Q-learning, SARSA, and deep reinforcement learning algorithms like Deep Q-Networks (DQN).\n",
            "* **Semi-supervised Learning**:  A combination of labeled and unlabeled data is used for training.  This approach is useful when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming.\n",
            "* **Self-supervised Learning**: Creates its own labels from the data and learns from them.  A common example is predicting the next word in a sentence.\n",
