    "# OOPs (Object Oriented Programming)\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a programming paradigm based on the objects, these objects can contain data, attributes and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why we use OOPS?\n",
    " 1. Reusability => Code can be reused through inheritence and classes reducing redundancy.\n",
    " 2. Modularity => Programs are divided into objects making them easy to understand & maintain.\n",
    " 3. Data protection => Encapsulation helps restrict access to  certain parts of an object.\n",
    " 4. Flexibility => Polymorphism allows the same interface to interact with different types of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Key concepts of OOPS:\n",
    " 1. Class => A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It deefines a structure to hold data(attributes) & Functions(Methods) related to that object.\n",
    " 2. Objects => An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity created using the class blueprint.\n",
    " 3. Self => Self is a reference to the current interface of the class. It allows us to access the object's attributes & methods. It must be the first        parameter in instance method. When we calling a method self is passed automatically.\n",
    " 4. Attributes => Attributes are variables that hold data about an object. They are defined inside a class & represent the properties & state of an          object.  eg- self.name = name.\n",
    " 5. Methods => Methods are functions defined inside a class that operate on the object's attributes. They define the behaviour of an object.\n",
    "    \n",
    "# What happens if we not use self?\n",
    "If self is not used, the method will not have a way to refer to the object calling it. Python will raise an error when trying to access instance attributes/methods inside the class as they are not explicity connected to the instance."

    "# Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How Encapsulation works?\n",
    "Three methods => Public, Private, and Protected\n",
    " 1. Public Attributes - Directly Accessible\n",
    " 2. Protected Attributes - Use a single underscore attributes\n",
    " 3. Private Attributes - use double underscore attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation involves restricting direct access to some of the object attributes and methods to protect the intergrity of the data. This is typically done by making attributes private and exposing them through public methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why is Encapsulation Imp ?\n",
    " 1. It improves data security by restricting unauthorised access.\n",
    " 2. It promoted modularity by hidding implementation details.\n",
    " 3. It enables control over the data by providing controlled access through methods. It enhances code maintainability and reusability by protecting data     from unintended modification.\n",
